If it also takes care of vehicle insurance, then it will violates this.</p> </li> <li> <p>\u2018O\u2019 stands for Open/Closed Principle:</p> <p>It means Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.</p> <p>For Example: We have a VehicleService class that provides maintenance services. Later, we need to add a new service type for electric vehicles and if without modifying VehicleService, we are able to extend it from a subclass ElectricVehicleService then it follows this priciple.</p> </li> <li> <p>\u2018L\u2019 stands for Liskov Substitution Principle: It means Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the program\u2019s correctness.</p> <p>basically do not override behavior of the class</p> <p>For Example: If we have a superclass Vehicle with a method startEngine(), and subclasses like Car and ElectricCar, we should be able to replace Vehicle with Car or ElectricCar in our system without any functionality breaking. If ElectricCar can\u2019t implement startEngine() because it doesn\u2019t have a traditional engine, it should still work with the interface to not break the system.</p> </li> <li> <p>\u2018I\u2019 for Interface Segregation Principle: It means do not force any client to depend on methods it does not use; split large interfaces into smaller ones.</p> <p>For Example: Instead of one large interface VehicleOperations with methods like drive, refuel, charge, and navigate, split it into focused interfaces like Drivable, Refuelable, and Navigable. An ElectricCar wouldn\u2019t need to implement Refuelable, just Chargeable and Navigable.</p> </li> <li> <p>\u2018D\u2019 stands for Dependency Inversion Principle: It means High-level modules should not depend directly on low-level modules but should communicate through abstractions like interfaces.</p> <p>For Example: If a VehicleTracker class needs to log vehicle positions, it shouldn\u2019t depend directly on a specific GPS device model. Instead, it should interact through a GPSDevice interface, allowing any GPS device that implements this interface to be used without changing the VehicleTracker class.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Questions-list/CoreJava/#q127-what-is-a-thread-in-java-and-how-can-we-create-it","title":"Q127.

This allows for better decoupling between classes, as the classes are not directly responsible for creating their dependencies. Instead, dependencies are provided to them from external sources, such as a DI container or framework.</p> <p>DI promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability by making classes more reusable and easier to mock or substitute during testing.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Questions-list/SpringBootQues/#q6-what-is-the-role-of-ioc-container-in-spring","title":"Q6. What is the role of IOC container in Spring?","text":"<p>The IoC container in Spring manages the creation and setup of objects.

What are the types of IOC container in Spring?","text":"<p>In Spring, there are two main types of IoC containers: BeanFactory and ApplicationContext. BeanFactory is the basic container that handles creating and managing objects. ApplicationContext is more advanced, adding features like event handling and easier integration with Spring\u2019s tools. Most developers prefer ApplicationContext because it offers more capabilities and is easier to use.</p>"},{"location":"Questions-list/SpringBootQues/#q8-what-is-the-use-of-configuration-and-bean-annotations-in-spring","title":"Q8. What is the use of <code>@Configuration</code> and <code>@Bean</code> annotations in Spring?","text":"<p><code>@Configuration</code> indicates that a class contains <code>@Bean</code> definitions, and Spring IoC container can use it as a source of bean definitions. <code>@Bean</code> is used on methods to define beans managed by the Spring container. These methods are called by Spring to obtain bean instances.</p> <p>Which Is the Best Way of Injecting Beans and Why?</p> <p>The best way to inject beans in Spring is using constructor injection. It ensures that all necessary parts are provided when the object is created. This makes the object more reliable and easier to test because its dependencies are clear and cannot change.</p> <p>Difference between Constructor Injection and Setter Injection?</p> <p>Constructor injection gives dependencies to an object when it is created, ensuring they are ready to use immediately. Setter injection gives dependencies through setter methods after the object is created, allowing changes later. Constructor injection makes sure all needed dependencies are available right away, while setter injection allows for more flexibility in changing or adding optional dependencies later.</p>"},{"location":"Questions-list/SpringBootQues/#q9-what-are-the-different-bean-scopes-in-spring","title":"Q9.

This way, Kafka can manage large amounts of data efficiently and quickly, making the system work better as it scales up.</p> <p>Discuss how Kafka achieves fault tolerance.</p> <p>Kafka achieves fault tolerance by making copies of data and spreading it across different servers. Each topic is split into parts called partitions, and each part is duplicated on multiple servers. If one server fails, Kafka can still access the data from the other servers with copies. ZooKeeper helps manage which server is in charge of each part, ensuring everything keeps running smoothly even if some servers have problems.</p>"},{"location":"Questions-list/kafka/#q17-what-is-the-role-of-replication-in-kafka","title":"Q17.

How do you achieve this?</p> <p>To ensure that messages with the same key are processed in order, you should use a partition key.</p> <p>Kafka guarantees that messages with the same key will go to the same partition and, within a partition, messages are ordered. So, by assigning the same key to related messages, you can ensure they are sent to the same partition and processed in order.</p> <p>You notice that your Kafka consumers are lagging behind, unable to keep up with the rate at which messages are being produced. What steps would you take to address this issue?</p> <p>To address consumer lag, I would:</p> <ul> <li>Scale out consumers: Increase the number of consumer instances to parallelize message processing.</li> <li>Optimize consumer code: Review and optimize the consumer application to process messages more efficiently.</li> <li>Increase partition count: Add more partitions to the topic to enable better parallelism if the number of consumers is limited by the current partition count.</li> <li>Adjust configurations: Tune Kafka and consumer configurations, such as fetch.min.bytes and fetch.max.wait.ms, to balance the load and improve throughput.</li> <li>Monitor resource usage: Ensure that the consumers have enough CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.</li> </ul> <p>Your application requires exactly-once processing semantics. How do you configure Kafka to achieve this?</p> <p>To achieve exactly-once semantics in Kafka, I would:</p> <ul> <li>Enable Idempotence: Ensure that the producer is configured with enable.idempotence=true. This ensures that duplicate messages are not produced.</li> <li>Transactional APIs: Use Kafka\u2019s transactional APIs by starting a transaction with the producer, sending messages, and committing the transaction. This can be done using the beginTransaction, send, and commitTransaction methods.</li> </ul> <p>Consumer Configuration: Configure consumers to commit offsets only after the transaction \u2022</p> <p>is successfully completed, ensuring that messages are processed exactly once.</p> <p>You need to update the schema of the messages being produced to a Kafka topic without disrupting the existing consumers. How do you handle schema evolution in Kafka?</p> <p>To handle schema evolution in Kafka:</p> <ul> <li>Use Schema Registry: Utilize Confluent Schema Registry to manage and version schemas. Producers and consumers can automatically retrieve and validate schemas.</li> <li>Backward Compatibility: Ensure that the new schema is backward compatible with the old schema. This allows consumers to continue processing messages using the old schema while producers start using the new schema.</li> </ul> <p>Schema Validation: Configure producers to validate messages against the latest schema \u2022</p> <p>version before sending them to Kafka, and configure consumers to validate incoming messages against the expected schema version.</p> <p>Your application requires high availability and fault tolerance for the Kafka cluster. How do you configure Kafka to meet these requirements?</p> <p>To ensure high availability and fault tolerance in Kafka:</p> <ul> <li>Replication Factor: Set a replication factor greater than 1 for your topics. This ensures that data is replicated across multiple brokers.</li> <li>ISR (In-Sync Replicas): Ensure that the min.insync.replicas configuration is set appropriately (typically to a value less than the replication factor but more than 1) to guarantee that a minimum number of replicas are in sync before acknowledging a write.</li> </ul> <p>Acks Configuration: Configure the producer with acks=all to ensure that the producer waits \u2022</p> <p>for acknowledgment from all in-sync replicas before considering a message as successfully produced.</p> <ul> <li>Monitoring and Alerts: Set up monitoring and alerting to detect broker failures and under- replicated partitions promptly.</li> <li>Cluster Maintenance: Regularly perform maintenance tasks, such as adding/removing brokers and rebalancing partitions, to ensure the cluster remains healthy and balanced.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Questions-list/maven/","title":"Maven","text":""},{"location":"Questions-list/maven/#q1-what-is-maven-and-what-problem-does-it-solve","title":"Q1.
