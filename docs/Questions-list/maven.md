### Q405. **What is Maven and what problem does it solve?**

Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It simplifies and standardizes the build process, manages dependencies, and provides project structure conventions.

### Q406. **What is a POM file in Maven?**

POM (Project Object Model) is an XML file that contains project information and configuration details required by Maven for building the project. It includes dependencies, plugins, and other settings.

### Q407. **What is the difference between compile and runtime dependencies in Maven?**

Compile dependencies are required for compiling the code, while runtime dependencies are only needed during execution. Maven manages these dependencies differently based on their scope.

### Q408. **Explain the Maven Lifecycle Phases.**

Maven has three built-in lifecycle phases: 

**clean**, —> default (or build), **—>**and site. Each phase is made up of a sequence of stages (or goals), which are executed in a specific order.

### Q409. **What is a Maven Repository?**

A Maven repository is a directory where all project jars, library jar, plugins, or any other project-specific artifacts are stored and can be easily used by Maven.

### Q410. **How do you exclude dependencies in Maven?**

You can exclude dependencies using the  element within the  tag in the POM file. This allows you to exclude specific transitive dependencies that you don’t need.

### Q411. **How can we optimize a Maven build for a large project?**

To optimize a Maven build for a large project, use dependency management, configure Maven to skip unnecessary tasks, use parallel builds, and leverage a local repository manager for faster artifact retrieval.

### Q412. **How do you run a Maven build?**

To run a Maven build, open your command line, navigate to the directory containing your project’s pom.xml file, and type mvn package to build the project.

### Q413. **What is the difference between mvn clean and mvn install?**

The difference between mvn clean and mvn install is that mvn clean removes files generated in the previous builds, cleaning the project, while mvn install compiles the project code and installs the built package into the local repository, making it available for other projects.

**Ques: How do you manage dependencies in a Maven project?**

In a Maven project, manage dependencies by listing them in the pom.xml file under the

tag. Maven automatically downloads these from repositories and integrates them into your project.

**Ques: Explain Maven Life Cycle?**

Maven’s life cycle includes phases like compile, test, and deploy, which handle project building in a sequential manner. Each phase performs specific build tasks, such as compiling code, running tests, and packaging the compiled code into distributable formats like JARs or WARs.
